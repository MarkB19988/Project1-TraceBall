For this project I chose to use the IDE 'repl.it'. This is an online IDE that can be used by anyone and supports a wide variety
of programming languages, including the language I was using (Javascript). It displays the text editor on the left side of the screen
and displays the code as it would look when it is run on the right of the screen. It changes the color of certain parts of your code 
to help make the code clearer to understand.

To aid in debugging, 'repl.it' will display on the right hand side, any errors that occour when trying to run the code. It will tell me
what line of my code the error is on, and what the computer is expecting. This is very helpful to programmers as they can see exactly
where the error is and how to fix it
