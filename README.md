### I. Description
In this game, the player will control a square by moving their mouse cursor within the game window. The player will be chased by an NPC square that will attempt to touch the players square. If the two collide, the player will lose a life. After 3 lives are lost, the game is over.

### II. User Stories
1. As a player, I would like to be able to play the game in a browser because I would be able to play it on multiple devices.
2. As a player, I would want my character to follow my mouse cursor so that I can control it.
3. As a player, I woud want the NPC to chase my character so that the game has challenge
4. As a player, I would like to be able to see both characters so that I have a fair chance at the game

6. As a player, I would like to know when I have come into contact with the NPC so that I know when I am losing lives

### III. Genre
This project will be a 2D, top down, casual arcade game

### IV. Technical Details

##### Programming Language/Enviroment
I will be developing this game using Javascript as instructed in the brief. The game will be able to run on any web browser but will require a mouse to work correctly (Not touch screen compatable)

Also as instructed in the brief, I will be writing my code in Notepad. Notepad is a simple text editor that offers no helpful features or a 

##### Programming Challenges
During this project, I will need to find a solution to the following problems/challenges.

  - How to make the players square follow the mouse presicely 
  
##### Coding Standards 
While writing my code, I chose to use indenting rather than spacing, I chose this for two main reasons. Firstly, for me personally, using the tab button is intuative and saves time on not pressing repeatedly or holding the space button. Secondly, tabs are universal for all text editiors, therefor they will appear consistent, regardless of which text editior is used.

Another coding standard I wrote with was to place '{' directly underneath previous statements instead of at the begining of a new line, especially within 'if' statements. This was 100% a personal choice as both options will work exactly the same, I simply prefer not to have to jump to the begining of a new line while reading my code.
