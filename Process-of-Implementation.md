Constructing and implementing my code 

To start constructing my code I used the internet to find out how to construct a basic canvas. In order to learn more about how the code
works, my technique was to change different aspects of the code and see the results of my changes compared to the original. by doing this
I am able to disect the section of code and can transfer the knowledge I gain to other functions and progamming languages. For example,
once I learned how to stlye a canvas, I was able to transfer this knowlege and know how to style rectangles and otehr shapes within the 
game, as the code was similar.

Algorithms

The main alogorithm I needed to use was a collision detection algorithm to be used between the player character and the NPC. I started by
researching a basic collision detection algorithm between two objects and started my process of working backwards and disecting the code
in order to understand it and adapt it to fit my game. This process took alot longer than I had anticipated because disecting the
algorithm was proving difficult as I was unable to achieve my desired results when changing bits of the code. Specifically, checking the
co-ordinates of the two characters (collisions were being detected even though they were not visabley touching. However with persistence
I was able to solve this problem.
